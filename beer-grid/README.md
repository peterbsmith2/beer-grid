# BeerGrid

A demonstration project for AngularNYC October Meetup as part of the *Web Design is design in the Web* talk. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.0.

## About
This demo project is a sample walkthrough on how to create a beer board for display in a bar or restaurant, as well as on a mobile device. The goal of the walkthrough is to demonstrate how to design in the browser, using Angular as our platform to create our design using real data. ( No Lorem Ipsum please...)
