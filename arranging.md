### Invention
- Ford UX
  - take keys out of the pocket when you have full hands
  - even with wireless, still gotta take them out
  - if we can detect the keyfob, put your foot under the bumper, lift the trunk

Hi, I'm James. I started as a print desginer, working on projects like public signage, magazine layouts, and packaging for chocolates. Today, I design User Interfaces for web applications. In the beginning of the transition, I was using tools from my print background to build static mockups of web applications - photoshop, illustrator, and more.  
  
When the web was starting to become a force the world, anyone could do the whole page themselves. HTML, CSS, and rudimentary JavaScript - with those skills a hobbyist could create a page in a week or less, by themselves, with no experience. On early web projects my deliverables were concept art to be handed to developers for implementation.

Today there's an open question that designers and devlopers face: 'should designers code?' 

Web design is design in the web. So designers benefit from understanding the material they are working with. Examples of material, and constraints, of the web include: latency, different device sizes, inputs from voice to keyboards, camera access, and sensors. A designer uses the tools native to the medium. When designing for web that includes HTML, CSS, and rudimentary JavaScript. Modern frameworks and libraries like Angular, React, and Vue lend themselves to modularity, which enables designers to collaborate effectively with developers. Every UI bit is encapsulated and reusable, and these are core patterns seen in design outside of the web.

The result of working directly with the web is design at a speed that is faster than starting with high-fidelity static mockups, getting on a real browser, on a real phone earlier, and reducing the expensive back and forth with developers.

JavaScript for designers matters. Basic DOM manipulation, toggling classes, how to target elements, simple loops and if statements, handling a JSON file imitating real data, that's a designer needs. Developers handle state management and API interactions.

When designers and developers come together to work directly in the material of the web great things will happen!

#### Introduction
- james background related to design and development
- james
  - previously a design person whose developers didn't meet spec
#### Narration
- structure of design teams and development teams is rooted in advertising (old media? traditional mnfging?)
- [how the web started]
  - anyone could learn markup, css, and rudimentary javascript
- previous projects
  - waterfall design isnt rooted in reality
  - deliverables are utopian, concept art
- comes from print design background
  - signage all about usability  
#### Division
- "should designers code?"
#### Proof
- starts to answer who is a desgin technologist
- HTML/CSS
- Angular/React/Vue
  - lend themselves to this
  - all frameworks that embrace modularity, every UI bit is encapsulated and reusable
    - a part of design 101
    - patterns
- faster than going through static mockups
  - it gets on a device even if its lo-fi
- on a real browser, on a real phone
- skills:
  - HTML/CSS
  - JS
    - DOM manipulation
    - toggling classes
    - how to target elements
    - simple loops and if statements
    - handling a JSON file (imitating real data)
      - get real copy in the design
    - NOT - classes, state management, API interactions
- understanding the material
  - latency
  - different device sizes
  - fluid device usage (same user, different devices)
  - different inputs (touch, gestures, voice, keyboard/mouse)
  - geolocation, camera, light sensor, accelerometer, other sensors
#### Refutation
- not about art, not about the pixel-perfect
- death to lorem ipsum
  - what happens when real data wraps the text
