### Invention
- keep components out of application code
- cares about @inputs and @outputs
  - understand attribute and event binding
- dev technologist doesnt think about state management at application level
  - only at component level, internal state, composable state
- think about the state of component in all use cases
  - controls
    - hover
    - disabled
    - focus
    - active
- doesn't think about start starting the project
  - cli, nx, xplat
- can be a separate codebase from the application
  - good for design systems [lookup the talk about this from previous AngularNYC where Peter spoke]
- 8 pixel grid
- SCSS and any css origanizational systems/tools
  - understanding cascade
  - understanding scoping
- React is hardcore on removing the cascade
  - there are great parts of cascade
  - 8 libraries for using js instead of CSS
- BEM: block element modifier namespacing
- doesn't think about APIs, ngrx
- might deal services for interactive bits (modals)
- basic understanding of lifecycle hooks
- skeleton loaders are an example of knowing the material
  - requires understanding of lifecycle hooks
- designers can make better UX by speaking with developers outside of a divisive static design tool
- know about git
- resources
  - images, assets, serve the appropriate (smaller, lower quality images)
- there isn't a spec to meet, theres a user story to accept
- @HostListener
- ChangeDetection OnPush
- basic component style scoping
- still need
  - sketch / figma / adobe XD
    - for exploration and iteration
      - quickly figure out composition
  - similar to codepen (its not a deliverable)
  - not for deliverables
- code is the source of truth
- need low-fidelity wireframing
  - even cheaper and faster than code (whiteboarding)
  - maybe balsamiq
- as soon as you have something people can play with, you stop talking about pixels and you talk about features
  - previously worked in static design the worst thing is here is where we are...
    - "can you change the headline?"
    - "too much whitespace"
- keep focus on the product
  - keep the discussion the product
- get to a higher level of quality to start with
- you play with to find out the answer
- design has a smell
- builds trust in the deliverable
  - you can go low-fidelity wide
  - high-fidelity narrow
