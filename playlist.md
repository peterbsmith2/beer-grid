### Invention
- Empty Project
- have some heroku stuff for deployment?
- some sense that we're doing API interactions?
  - model file
  - 
Generate a Data Model
- cats

SASS architecture from the beginning
  - 8 pixel grid
  - space, color, and type
  - work directly in the material of the web
  - gives developers some options for whats available to mess with (s,m,l..t-shirt sizing)
  - some configurable type demo
    - change values and show how that cascades to the design system level
    - for designers this is like symbols in sketch?
  - print designers have been doing this forever

<card>, <card-content>

<card-header>

<card-image>

Loop an Array and show a whole bunch of them

Design: go-to desktop

Bring in API Calls

Replace static data with live data 


- BEM
- A first input: <input>...
- A first display: 
  - <card-header>
  - <card-content>
  - <card-image>
- A first interaction: <input> modifies display
- Using a static data model
