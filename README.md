- there's a concept that the work of design and development are clearly divided in the sense that a designer does designer and a developer does development. this is about breaking that divide.

- the way forward is to get developers interacting with design tokens that live in the browser
- the way forward is to get designers working with components, css, and browser tools like chrome devtools

- there are a lot of tools that are considered designer-y and tools that are considered developer-y
   - on the web the tools are the same, both dev and designer use the same things in this concept

- benefit: dev bootcamp grads can do either design or dev, technically
- benefit: lower friction between design and development of end-product
